# ML---Supervised-Learning-Techniques
a. Supervised Learning is a machine learning technique where the model learns from labeled data.

b. The dataset includes input features and corresponding target outputs.

c. The goal is to predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

d. Common tasks: Classification (predict categories) and Regression (predict continuous values).

e. Algorithms: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, SVM, KNN, etc.

f. Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and MSE.

g. Requires a large, clean, and well-labeled dataset for accurate predictions.

# 1. Prepared Titanic dataset using data preprocessing techniques. Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, removed duplicates, and cleaned data. Applied Decision Tree algorithm for training and prediction. Performed evaluation using model performance metrics to analyze survival outcomes. 
# 2. Predicting House Prices Using Linear Regression. Given a dataset containing various features of houses such as size, number of bedrooms, location, etc., the task is to develop a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on these features.
# 3. Predicting Heart Disease Using Logistic Regression. Given a dataset containing various medical attributes of patients such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., along with whether they have heart disease or not, the goal is to utilize logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease.
# 4. Create a machine learning model to predict whether a person survived in Titanic or not. Perform EDA, apply Naive Bayes classifier, evaluate performance using Precision, Recall, F1 score, and accuracy, and apply hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
