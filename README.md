# ML---Supervised-Learning-Techniques
a. Supervised Learning is a machine learning technique where the model learns from labeled data.

b. The dataset includes input features and corresponding target outputs.

c. The goal is to predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

d. Common tasks: Classification (predict categories) and Regression (predict continuous values).

e. Algorithms: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, SVM, KNN, etc.

f. Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and MSE.

g. Requires a large, clean, and well-labeled dataset for accurate predictions.

# 1. Prepared Titanic dataset using data preprocessing techniques. Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, removed duplicates, and cleaned data. Applied Decision Tree algorithm for training and prediction. Performed evaluation using model performance metrics to analyze survival outcomes.
